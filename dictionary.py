# You can access the items of a dictionary by referring to its key name, inside square brackets
thisDict={
    "brand":"Ford",
    "model":"Mustang",
    "year":1964
}
print(thisDict["model"])
# get() method

# The keys() method will return a list of all the keys in the dictionary.

# Add a new item to the original dictionary, and see that the keys list gets updated as well:

car = {

}

x = car.keys()
print(x) #before the change

# Get a list of the values:

# Make a change in the original dictionary, and see that the values list gets updated as well:

"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}

x = car.values()

print(x) #before the change

"year": 1964
}

x = car.values()
print(x) #before the change

car["color"] = "red"
print(x) #after the change


# The items() method will return each item in a dictionary, as tuples in a list.
# Example
# Get a list of the key:value pairs

x = car.items()
print(x)

# Make a change in the original dictionary, and see that the items list gets updated as well:

"year": 1964
}

x = car.items()

print(x) #before the change

# Check if Key Exists
# To determine if a specified key is present in a dictionary use the in keyword:

# Example
# # Check if "model" is present in the dictionary:

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
if "model" in thisdict:
  print("Yes, 'model' is one of the keys in the thisdict dictionary")


# Removing Items
# There are several methods to remove items from a dictionary:

# The pop() method removes the item with the specified key name:

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict.pop("model")
print(thisdict)


# The popitem() method removes the last inserted item (in versions before 3.7, a random item is removed instead):

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(thisdict)
thisdict.popitem()
print(thisdict)


# The del keyword removes the item with the specified key name:

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
del thisdict["model"]
print(thisdict)


# he del keyword can also delete the dictionary completely:

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
del thisdict
# print(thisdict) #this will cause an error because "thisdict" no longer exists.


# The clear() method empties the dictionary:

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
# thisdict.clear()
print(thisdict)


# Print all key names in the dictionary, one by one:

for x in thisdict:
  print(x)


# Print all values in the dictionary, one by one:

for x in thisdict:
  print(thisdict[x])


# You can also use the values() method to return values of a dictionary:

for x in thisdict.values():
  print(x)
# Example
# You can use the keys() method to return the keys of a dictionary:

for x in thisdict.keys():
  print(x)


# Loop through both keys and values, by using the items() method:

for x, y in thisdict.items():
  print(x, y)


#   Copy a Dictionary
# You cannot copy a dictionary simply by typing dict2 = dict1, because: dict2 will only be a reference to dict1, and changes made in dict1 will automatically also be made in dict2.

# There are ways to make a copy, one way is to use the built-in Dictionary method copy().

# ExampleGet your own Python Server
# # Make a copy of a dictionary with the copy() method:

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
mydict = thisdict.copy()
print(mydict)

# Create a dictionary that contain three dictionaries:

myfamily = {
  "child1" : {
    "name" : "Emil",
    "year" : 2004
  },
  "child2" : {
    "name" : "Tobias",
    "year" : 2007
  },
  "child3" : {
    "name" : "Linus",
    "year" : 2011
  }
}

print(myfamily)


# Create three dictionaries, then create one dictionary that will contain the other three dictionaries:

child1 = {
  "name" : "Emil",
  "year" : 2004
}
child2 = {
  "name" : "Tobias",
  "year" : 2007
}
child3 = {
  "name" : "Linus",
  "year" : 2011
}

myfamily = {
  "child1" : child1,
  "child2" : child2,
  "child3" : child3
}

print(myfamily)


# To access items from a nested dictionary, you use the name of the dictionaries, starting with the outer dictionary:

# Example
# Print the name of child 2:

print(myfamily["child2"]["name"])

# Loop through the keys and values of all nested dictionaries:
myfamily = {
  "child1" : {
    "name" : "Emil",
    "year" : 2004
  },
  "child2" : {
    "name" : "Tobias",
    "year" : 2007
  },
  "child3" : {
    "name" : "Linus",
    "year" : 2011
  }
}

for x, obj in myfamily.items():
    print(x)
    
    for y in obj:
        print(y + ':', obj[y])



# Dictionary Methods
# Python has a set of built-in methods that you can use on dictionaries.

# Method	Description
# clear()	Removes all the elements from the dictionary
# copy()	Returns a copy of the dictionary
# fromkeys()	Returns a dictionary with the specified keys and value
# get()	Returns the value of the specified key
# items()	Returns a list containing a tuple for each key value pair
# keys()	Returns a list containing the dictionary's keys
# pop()	Removes the element with the specified key
# popitem()	Removes the last inserted key-value pair
# setdefault()	Returns the value of the specified key. If the key does not exist: insert the key, with the specified value
# update()	Updates the dictionary with the specified key-value pairs
# values()	Returns a list of all the values in the dictionary
